    "\"Archaeologists try to find the clues left by people who lived before us, and they try to make sense of them.\" ([Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFejIkYDH9Q)). This work is no different for software developers maintaining older systems, who venture as software archaeologists into old codebases like adventurers in a long-forgotten city. Many tasks are the same, such as deciphering the hieroglyphs (aka cryptic abbreviations) left behind by the original creators, unlocking valuable knowledge hidden beneath layers of history. And just as traditional archaeologists piece together ancient stories, software archaeologists help to understand the stories of legacy systems that have stood the test of time, and paving the way for a successful modernization journey."

    "I tried to find and analyze a real legacy code base. But it's really hard to get a realistic scenario. This is where the \"Mainframe CardDemo Application\" ([GitHub](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-mainframe-modernization-carddemo)) from AWS comes into play: This project is a sample application designed to showcase modernization strategies for mainframe workloads using AWS services. It features a typical banking scenario with COBOL programs, JCL scripts, and related data files. The demo should provide a realistic environment to demonstrate refactoring, replatforming, and migration of legacy code to cloud-based solutions. Albeit the abount of files that this project consists of is tiny, I think this is one realistig starting point for exploring an unkown legacy application written in a programming language I'm not familiar with."

    "The base prompt was designed to guide the LLM in extracting and expanding abbreviations. I paid attention to providing clear, step-by-step instructions to help the LLM through abbreviation extraction and concept definition. I included handling for alternative meanings and uncertainty by suggesting confidence scores and alternative entries. Additionally, I requested simple regex patterns for practical file matching, which can be useful later for finding all relevant files based on the extracted patterns. I specified a structured output as a JSON schema for consistency and easier integration with subsequent analysis. To my knowledge, Sonnet doesn’t have a built-in option for this kind of structured output, so I also included an example to clarify expectations (and to avoid breaking the following code)."

    "Next, I search for all files that correspond to the pattern in the `regex` column, we can now assign the real files to a given abbreviation / concept. I iterate through the list of known abbreviations, using their regular expressions to find matching files in the project. For each abbreviation, I refine the regex, apply it to filter the file list, and update the list of unmatched files. The matched files and their proportion of the total file count are stored for each abbreviation, and the results are added to the DataFrame for analysis. However, this approach isn't entirely clean, as files can belong to multiple concepts or match more than one abbreviation, leading to potential overlaps. But I think this is good enough for now."

    "In this analysis, I applied a LLM-assisted approach to decipher abbreviations embedded in a legacy codebase, focusing on enhancing our understanding of key business and technical concepts. By leveraging a well-structured prompt and an iterative feedback loop, I extracted abbreviations, expanded their meanings, and linked them to relevant files using regular expressions. The high coverage of identifiable abbreviations indicates a comprehensive grasp of the code's structure and purpose. This iterative method allows us to refine the analysis based on previously discovered information, avoiding redundancy and increasing the accuracy of the interpretations. The generated insights gained can provide a solid foundation for upcoming modernization efforts and help understanding the critical business logic of a legacy application."
