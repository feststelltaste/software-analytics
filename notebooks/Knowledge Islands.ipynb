    "# Introduction\n",
    "In software development, it's all about the knowledge &ndash; both technical and the business domain. But we software developers transfer only a small part of this knowledge into code. So code alone isn't sufficient to get a glimpse of the greater picture and the interrelations of all the different concepts. There will be always developers that know more about some concept as laid down in the source code. It's important to make sure that this knowledge is distributed over more than one head. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's possible to estimate this knowledge distribution by analyzing the version control system. We can use active changes in the code as proxy for \"someone know what he does\", because otherwise, he wouldn't be able to contribute code. To find spots where the knowledge about the code could be improved, we can identify areas in the code that are possibly known by only one developer. This gives you a hint where you should start some pair programming of a invest in redocumentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can approximate the knowledge distribution by counting the number of additions per file that each developer contributed to a software system.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll show you step by step how you can do this by using Python and [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/).\n",

    "Attribution: The work is heavily inspired by Adam Tornhill's book [\"Your Code as a Crime Scene\"](https://pragprog.com/book/atcrime/your-code-as-a-crime-scene), who did a similar analysis called \"knowledge map\"."
