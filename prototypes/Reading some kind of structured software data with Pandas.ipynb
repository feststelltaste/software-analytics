    "# Introduction\n",
    "Sometimes you want to read in data that contains different kinds of information per line. This could be a log file where some lines contain a timestamp and the log messages itself, but other lines could contain specific information about errors or stack traces. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing that we need to accomplish is to read in the file into Pandas. There is a nice little trick that you can use to read almost every kind of structured data into a Pandas DataFrame. By using a separator that doesn't occur in the dataset, we can read in the content of a file line by line. Once we have the data into a DataFrame, we can use Pandas functionality to reshape the data as we need it.\n",

    "# Example data set\n",

    "This is a pretty challenging dataset: Albeit we have some lines that could be used as markers (like \"`commit:`\", \"`Author`\" and \"`Date:`\"), we also have multiple lines without a marker text. Luckily, there is some convention here: The first line in this particular dataset is the so called \"subject\" or \"title line\", the other lines is the \"full commit message\". This makes it possible to differentiate between these two kind of information as well. So the data structure for one complete Git log entry looks like this (from [doc](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#_pretty_formats)):\n",

    "Let's start by reading in the given dataset. Especially take a look at the choosen `sep` parameter: After hours of <strike>trial and error</strike> research, I've found the Unicode character \"DEVICE CONTROL TWO\" very suitable as separator. As of today, I hadn't come across any datasets where this character is included. By using it's Unicode character code `u0012`, we can read in the dataset line by line. \n",

    "We also make use of the `skipinitialspace` parameter. This will not delete the whitespace in front of the first characters. In our case, this is very useful because the commit's subject and message lines are prefixed with four whitespace characters. By setting `skipinitialspace=False`, we can ensure that we don't interpret this data wrongly as some other type of data like the commit or author line.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one keyword that could be useful for this task, too, but isn't used here. The `skip_blank_lines` parameter will not jump over lines in the given dataset, that are empty. Again, the use of this parameters depends highly on your kind if data."
