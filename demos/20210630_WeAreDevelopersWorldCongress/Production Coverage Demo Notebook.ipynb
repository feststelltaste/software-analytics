    "To understand how much code isn't used, we recorded the executed code in production with the coverage tool [JaCoCo](http://www.jacoco.org/). The measurement took place between 21st Oct 2017 and 27st Oct 2017. The results were exported into a CSV file using the JaCoCo command line tool with the following command:\n",
